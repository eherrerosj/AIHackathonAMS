# Server

This directory contains the old and new implementations of the server done throughout the hackathon.

Please note the server was built using python3.

For the current implementation of the server:

- ## Start the worker

Ensure that redis is running and that the url and port in `worker.py` are set properly.

`python worker.py`

- ## Start the server

`python run.py`

You should be be good to make requests to the server.
